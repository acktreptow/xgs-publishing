# Xbox Games Studios Publishing Bootstrap Homepage

I produce a series where I analyze the state of every internal Xbox developer for my YouTube channel. However, when I began researching for XGS Publishing's episode, I was stunned to see that they didn't have their own website. Despite making many of Xbox's most recent critically acclaimed games.

So, I figured I'd make one for them as they deserve it! With Bootstrap being the framework I would create this homepage on, as Meta's Front-End Developer program only gave me limited/non-graded experience with it.

## Technologies used:

- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript
- Mapbox API

## Project Overview

Overall, this was one of the more fun projects I have created!

As I am already familiar with the subject matter, I could focus on developing my Bootstrap skills and incorporate as many layouts and components as possible. That's why the homepage has numerous features like both grid and flexbox, modals, a hamburger menu for mobile screens, forms, cards, an accordion, Bootstrap icons etc.

I have also adhered to responsive design, incorporated some vanilla JavaScript for extra functionality, and implemented the Mapbox api to make the homepage more professional looking. Thanks to this project, I can confidently say I have a solid grasp of Bootstrap.

Finally, due to little hands-on experience with Bootstrap during Meta's Front-End Developer program, my ability to read through/understand documentation has also significantly increased. Which is best showcased by vanilla CSS only being applied on media queries and the Mapbox. This wasn't the goal of the project, but it's a nice side effect nonetheless!

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/acktreptow/xgsp-bootstrap.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd xgsp-bootstrap`
3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Future Enhancements

I'd like to reference proper links for the games' social media icons at some point. Other, less complete projects will be prioritized though, as this doesn't affect the goal of the project. To showcase my Bootstrap skills.
