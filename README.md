# Xbox Games Studios Publishing Bootstrap Homepage

A Boostrap homepage for Xbox's publishing arm.

## Technologies Used:

- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Bootstrap
- Mapbox API

## Project Overview

After finishing Meta's Front-End Developer certification, I wanted to get more hands-on experience with Bootstrap as the syllabus was limited in this area.

As I am already familiar with Xbox, I could focus on developing my Bootstrap skills by incorporating as many layouts and components as possible. That's why the homepage has numerous features like both grid and flexbox, modals, a hamburger menu for mobile screens, forms, cards, an accordion, Bootstrap icons etc.

I have also adhered to responsive design, incorporated some vanilla JavaScript for extra functionality, and implemented the Mapbox api to make the homepage more professional looking. Thanks to this project, I can confidently say I have a solid grasp of Bootstrap.

Finally, due to the limited hands-on experience during Meta's Front-End Developer program, my ability to read through/understand documentation has also significantly increased. This wasn't the goal of the project, but it's a nice side effect nonetheless!

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository (for Git): `git clone https://github.com/acktreptow/xgs-publishing.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd xgs-publishing`
3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser

## Future Enhancements

I'd like to reference proper links for the games' social media icons at some point. Other, less complete projects will be prioritized though, as this doesn't affect the goal of the project. Which was to showcase my Bootstrap skills.
