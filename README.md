# Xbox Games Studios Publishing Application

A Boostrap homepage for Xbox's publishing arm.

## Technologies Used:

- Bootstrap
- JavaScript
- Mapbox API
- CSS
- HTML

## Project Overview

After finishing Meta's Frontend Developer certification, I wanted to get more hands-on experience with Bootstrap as the syllabus was limited in this area.

That's why the homepage has a myriad of features like modals, a hamburger menu for mobile screens, forms, cards, an accordion, Bootstrap icons etc. I also incorporated some vanilla JavaScript and called the Mapbox api to make the homepage more interactive.

Finally, due to the limited Bootstrap experience during Meta's syllabus, my ability to read through framework/library documentation has also significantly increased. This wasn't the primary goal, but it's a nice side effect nonetheless!

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository (for Git): `git clone https://github.com/acktreptow/xgs-publishing.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd xgs-publishing`
3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser

## Future Enhancements

I achieved my goal of improving and showcasing my Bootstrap skills so there will be no major updates.
